# Face-recognition

Basically just me learning about open-cv and a cool little project; which i followed a tutorial by Sentdex. 

uses OpenCV2 and Face Recognition modules to recognize your face; also, will put the name of the person in a green box around their head. 

<p><strong>How To Use&nbsp;<img src="https://html-online.com/editor/tinymce4_6_5/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-laughing.gif" alt="laughing" /></strong></p>
<p>1. Download ZIP of Repository</p>
<p>2. Un-Zip</p>
<p>3. Make folders: "known_faces" and "unknown_faces" in main folder where you've extracted zips</p>
<p>3. Make a folder with the name of the person you want to recognize in the "known_faces" folder</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt; Create folder "&lt;name&gt;" in "known_faces"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt; Enter Multiple pictures of said person in the folder you just made</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Pictures have to be ONLY of one person-- the person you want to recognize</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IF</strong></span> Not doing video recognitions:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Enter a picture with multiple people (with the person you want to recognize with them) into the "unknown_faces" folder</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Run "recFace.py"</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ELSE:</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Run "recFaceVideo.py"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Camera will pop up and record a real-time video of you.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - The program will use the faces in the "known_faces" folder and try to recognize you</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - The name displayed will be the name of the folder</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
